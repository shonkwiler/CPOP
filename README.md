# Confined Polygons from Order Polytopes #


This repository gives a reference implementation of the Confined Polygons from Order Polytopes (CPOP) algorithm introduced in the following paper:

* Clayton Shonkwiler and Kandin Theis. Direct sampling of confined polygons in linear time. Preprint, 2025.

CPOP is implemented as a compiled Mathematica function in [`CPOP.nb`](CPOP.nb). If you do not have Mathematica installed, this can be opened (but not evaluated) with the free [Wolfram Player](https://www.wolfram.com/player/).
